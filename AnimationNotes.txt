for the repeatMode for alpha animations: 
we have "restart" and "reverse"

the Animator.AnimatorListener interface is used to monitor animations
it has four methods:
1. onAnimationStart - notifies the start of animation
2. onAnimationEnd - notifies the end of animation (not called for animations whose
	repeatCount is infinite)
3. onAnimationRepeat - notifies the repetition of animation
4. onAnimationCancel - this is called when animation is cancelled. a cancelled animation also calls 
onAnimationEnd

the interface was implemented like this in kotlin:
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity(), Animator.AnimatorListener{...}

//just a revision, let's print a toast
Toast.makeText(this, "Your text", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()


the ValueAnimator class is a superclass of ObjectAnimator
